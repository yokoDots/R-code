### R-code 

Multi-Project Repository, a set of independent projects ranging from microbial data analysis to acoustic studies and urban biodiversity. Each folder includes a script or set of scripts.


#### ðŸ”¬ `Bugsigdb_fungi_signatures`
R scripts to identify fungal taxa in the **BugSigDB** curation database.
[BugSigDB](https://bugsigdb.org/Main_Page) is a curated database of published microbiome differential abundance signatures.

#### ðŸ§¬ `Bugsigdb_uncertain_taxa`
A script to handle **unidentified or uncertain nomenclature taxa** found in the BugSigDB dataset.
The initial goal was finding unmatched taxa and resolving ambiguous or missing taxonomic entries. Work in progress.

#### ðŸ¦œ `Grabaciones_ARubrogenys`
R scripts analyzing vocalizations of **Ara rubrogenys** (Red-fronted Macaw) recorded using different devices.
Can calls recorded with different equipment and techniques be used in the same acoustic analysis?

#### ðŸŒ³ `corredor_WaychaMayu`
Scripts using the **ARBU API**, a citizen science app, to fetch and analyze tree data along the Waycha Mayu urban biological corridor.
The initial exploratory phase to identify tree species, measure their frequency and height, and geolocate them along the corridor.
